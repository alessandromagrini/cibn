%\subsection{Illustration on a simple Bayesian network}
%\label{sub:illus}
%
%In order to illustrate the practical application of the CID, we propose a simple BN for the prediction of risk attitude in bank customers.
%The objective of this BN is to segment bank customers based on their risk attitude, a task of core importance for the bank to design personalized investment plans.
%The idea is that a customer with average risk attitude is oriented towards mixing its portfolio between the money and the stock market, while customers with high risk attitude prefer to rely mostly on the stock market, and, viceversa, customers with low risk attitude prefer to rely mostly on the money market.
%
%The BN includes the following variables:
%age in years (\texttt{Age}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Age}}=($`18--30', `31--50', `51 or more');
%education level (\texttt{Edu}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Edu}}=($`primary or less', `secondary', `tertiary');
%occupation (\texttt{Occup}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Occup}}=($`public employee', `private employee', 'freelancer`);
%marital status (\texttt{Marit}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Marit}}=($`single', `convivent');
%parentship (\texttt{Parent}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Parent}}=($`no', `yes');
%risk attitude (\texttt{Risk}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Risk}}=($`low', `average', `high');
%type of portfolio (\texttt{Portf}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Portf}}=($`mixed', `money market', `stock market').
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item Age in years (\texttt{Age}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Age}}=($`18--30', `31--50', `51 or more');
%%\item Education level (\texttt{Edu}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Edu}}=($`primary or less', `secondary', `tertiary');
%%\item Occupation (\texttt{Occup}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Occup}}=($`public employee', `private employee', 'freelancer`);
%%\item Marital status (\texttt{Marit}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Marit}}=($`single', `convivent');
%%\item Parentship (\texttt{Parent}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Parent}}=($`no', `yes');
%%\item Risk attitude (\texttt{Risk}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Risk}}=($`low', `average', `high');
%%\item Type of portfolio (\texttt{Portf}), with $\Omega_{\texttt{Portf}}=($`mixed', `money market', `stock market').
%%\end{itemize}
%
%The DAG of the BN, shown in Figure \ref{fig:bankrisk_dag}, is specified based on the following assumptions:
%(i) age, education level, marital status and parentship are each other independent;
%(ii) occupation depends on the education level, but it is independent of age, marital status and parentship;
%(iii) age, education level, occupation, marital status and parentship are direct causes of risk attitude;
%(iv) a causal interaction holds between martial status and parentship in determining risk attitude;
%(v) the type of portfolio is a direct consequence of risk attitude and, conditionally to risk attitude, is independent of all the other variables.
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item age, education level, marital status and parentship are each other independent;
%%\item occupation depends on the education level, but it is independent of age, marital status and parentship;
%%\item age, education level, occupation, marital status and parentship are direct causes of risk attitude;
%%\item a causal interaction holds between martial status and parentship in determining risk attitude;
%%\item the type of portfolio is a direct consequence of risk attitude and, conditionally to risk attitude, is independent of all the other variables.
%%\end{itemize}
%
%In order to establish type and reference state of each variable, it is necessary to interpret the meaning of the target variable, i.e., risk attitude (\texttt{Risk}), within the considered problem domain.
%\texttt{Risk} is an ordinal variable, but the state associated to a neutral situation is the middle one (`average'), because it entails an open-minded behaviour of the consumer towards the money and the stock market, while the other two states (`low' and `high') represent deviations in two different directions from this behaviour.
%For this reason, we specify \texttt{Risk} as a double-graded variable.
%The reference state for the other variables is established based on the association with average risk attitude.
%Specifically, we select `31--50' for \texttt{Age}, `secondary' for \texttt{Edu}, `public employee' for \texttt{Occup}, `single' for \texttt{Marit}, `no' for \texttt{Parent} and `mixed' for \texttt{Portf}.
%As a consequence, \texttt{Age} and \texttt{Edu} result ordinal variables with reference state in the middle of the sample space, thus they are considered as double-graded variables.
%Also, \texttt{Marit} and \texttt{Parent} are binary variables, thus they are considered as graded.
%Finally, \texttt{Occup} and \texttt{Portf} have three unordered states, thus they are considered as multi-valued nominal variables.
%Type, sample space and reference state of the variables in the BN are summarized in Table \ref{tab:bankrisk_info}.
